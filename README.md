Homework 2

Before I was able to properly loop through and output each unique ticker symbol in a different column, I used the AskBCS feature on slack. While the person I spoke to explained the errors of my previous code, they provided me assistance, which I ultimately did not use.

Most of the body of my code was inspired by our in-class example: credit_charges.

Daniel helped me understand and brainstorm the code for ticker_open and ticker_close.

The last section of my code (outputting max and min % change and greatest total volume) were from https://github.com/shrawantee/VBA-Scripting---Stock-Market-Analysis/blob/master/HW2_Hard_DS.vbs

I understood the code that needed to be written. I struggled with this section because I was trying to consolidate the format percent line with the line of code above.
